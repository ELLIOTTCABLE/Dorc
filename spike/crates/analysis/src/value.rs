//! `analysis::value` — book-side value-flow analysis (`19H §1`, `202 §1` face-book):
//! flow-sensitive constant + variable propagation over the existing [`Cfg`], solved by the
//! existing monotone worklist ([`crate::solve`]).
//!
//! For each command-site it answers: *what are this command's argv words, resolved?* Each
//! word is either a known literal string (interned to a [`Symbol`]) or [`ValueOf::Top`]
//! (`⊤` — runtime-dynamic / unmodeled / lost to quoting). This is the input the
//! entity-resolution pass (`19H §1.2`) and the post-probe fold (`19H §1.5`) both need; this
//! module computes the propagation only — it resolves nothing about oracles, picks no phase,
//! and licenses no elision (`inv-superposition`: phase-/orientation-agnostic facts).
//!
//! # The domain, and why the entry is seeded ⊤
//!
//! Per program point the state is a map *variable name ↦ abstract string value*. The abstract
//! value is the textbook constant-propagation element [`Flat`] (height 2: ⊥ below the
//! literals below ⊤) carried over **owned text** (`Flat<String>`) so concatenation needs no
//! live interner; [`MapL`] supplies the pointwise join, deterministic ordered iteration
//! (`inv-determinism`), and the canonical no-⊥ form. The final literal text is interned to a
//! [`Symbol`] only at the public boundary, where [`analyze`] holds the [`Interner`].
//!
//! The one non-obvious move: the **entry node seeds every assigned variable to `⊤`**, not the
//! worklist's default ⊥. This is required for shell-correctness *and* to ride `MapL`
//! unmodified (the MapL-friction flagged in the round-20 note). In shell an unset variable is
//! not a constant, so "uninitialised ⇒ ⊤"; without the seed, the half-assigned branch
//! `if c; then pkg=a; fi` would wrongly resolve `pkg` to `a`, because the else-path leaves
//! `pkg` *absent* and `MapL`'s pointwise join treats absent as ⊥ (its canonical-form premise:
//! absent ≡ ⊥), so `Elem(a) ⊔ ⊥ = Elem(a)`. Seeding the else-path's `pkg` to an explicit `⊤`
//! at entry makes the join `Elem(a) ⊔ ⊤ = ⊤` — the correct "maybe-`a`, maybe-unset ⇒
//! unknown". The seed is monotone (a constant function at the pred-less entry) and preserves
//! the worklist's ⊥-identity, so the lattice laws and termination hold.
//!
//! # Soundness posture (`19H §1.3`)
//!
//! Wherever propagation cannot follow a value it degrades to `⊤`, and a `⊤` word means the
//! consumer must run the command with that argument unparsed — the apply-direction floor
//! (`kFAIL-perform`). Non-convergence of the worklist folds the **entire** result to all-`⊤`
//! (`16P` DP-9): a capped solve is an under-approximation we must not trust.
