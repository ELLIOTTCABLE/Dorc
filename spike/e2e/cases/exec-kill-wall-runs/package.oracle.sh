# minimal package oracle (apt/dpkg), lifted statically by dorc.
# command-keyed predict(): the oracle's OWN argparse → inline kind-annotation (the real
# entity-resolution; task-W). Flag-strip (pre- and post-verb), bind the verb, annotate
# the single operand as `package`; the `[ "${2-}" = "" ]` guard refuses a SECOND operand
# (so `install nginx curl` resolves no probe ⇒ runs — no wrong single-entity elision).
